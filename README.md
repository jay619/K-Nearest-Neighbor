# K-Nearest-Neighbor
* Implementing KNN (K Nearest Neighbor), ENN (Edited Nerarest Neighbor) and CNN (Condensed Nearest Neighbor) from scratch and testing against 3 classification and 3 regression datasets.
* Libraries used: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
* data_pipeline.py - Used for pre-processing the data along with K-Fold cross validation for testing the model performance
* knn.py - Implementation for KNN, CNN and ENN
* test.py - Testing the 3 algorithms on 6 different datasets
